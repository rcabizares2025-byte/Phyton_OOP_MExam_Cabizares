26. Classes instances and methods
implement player with __init__ (name, score=0), independent name and score instance attributes, and add_points(points) which updates and returns that player's score.

27. Class attributes and shadowing
implement Device with a class attribute room innitially set to "Lab 1" and an initializer storing each asset_tag. The given calls change the attributes, then shadow it on one instance

28. Encapsulation with methods
Implement BankAccounts with _balance_, __init__ (initial_balance=0), get_balance(), deposit(amount), and withdraw(amount). Raise ValueError for negative initial balance, non positive deposits or withdrawaks, and withdrawals exceeding the balance.

29. Properties and validation
Implement Product with name, a validating price property backed by _price, and total(quantity). Reject any initial or assigned price of 0 or less with ValueError

30. Abstraction nad independent instance state
Implement ReadingList with a seperate _books list per instance, add_book(title), count (), and titles(). Reject blank or whitespace-only titles with ValueError. Return a copy from titles() so callers cannot modify the internal list.
